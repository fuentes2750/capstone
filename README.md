# capstone

This is the Capstone project code from my course DS785 DS MS degree. The code scripts for this project are broken into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage and Modeling. The EDA stage contains all the codes related to data cleaning, analysis and data preparation for the product recommendation models created for this project. The modeling stage contains the codes related to the product recommendation models done for the project, along with the code created to test the accuracy of the models. Each code script within the two stages will have a number in front of the name to indicate the order in which they were ran for this project. The first codes that should be used are the ones on the EDA stage, followed by the ones on the Modeling stage. Each stage will have its corresponding folder on this project.

The codes shown in this project were all done on python 3 with the exception of one of the modeling approaches which was the CF ALS model which was done on pySpark. The codes were all created on AWS SageMaker.
